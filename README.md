# Digital-Clock-using-Tinkercard-
I have develop this simple project in my 1st year of my Engineering. This is basically a simple design and simulation of digital clock. To use this simulation you have to use the BRD file and import that file in tinkercard. And you have to just click on start simulation. And aslo with that we have given you the pdf so that you can understand the the entire project.
